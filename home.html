       <p2><br>   I born and raised in India and moved to Australia in 2012. It was one my dream to become an IT professional. My lovely wife Ayswaria knows my passion and suggested me to do an undergraduate course in IT. After some deep researches, I decided to study with RMIT. I know, it will be a milestone in our life. My RMIT student ID is s3871492 and my RMIT email address is s3871492@student.rmit.edu.au
