       <p1>       I always curious and fascinated with robots in science fictional movies and novels. I wished to have one robot in my grandmother’s home to look after grandmother who was living alone and suffering with Alzheimer’s disease. She was keep forgetting to close the doors, forgot to prepare shopping list and having medicines or communicate with her daughters. I am very much aware of existing robots in the market in various industries from food production to aerospace but by considering my grandmother’s hard time, I wish to do an IT project to develop an extremely useful robot powered by artificial intelligence to assist People who suffering Alzheimer's disease.
           <br>
           
       </p1>
       <p2><br>      My grandmother had Alzheimer’s disease and she had many difficulties including loss of memory, thinking and behaviour. This disease can affect anyone of any age but most patients with disease get diagnosed after age of 65. Dementia Australia, a member of ‘Alzheimer’s disease International’ says 70 % of dementia patients are having Alzheimer’s disease. Aim of my IT project is to provide a robotic medical assistance with the help of artificial intelligence. Name of my robot will be “RoboAD”. This robot will monitor Alzheimer’s disease patients, gather most of vital medical information from the patients, can be controlled with voice assistance, can make this robot as communication tool; can able to work as a robotic medical assistant to do multiple caretaker functions to make their life better.  
           <br>
       
       </p2><br>
       <p3>  Mission of my project is to replace a human medical assistant with RoboAD with the help of powerful machine learning AI platform, operating system and software. I wish to create a robot with a unique combination of science, technology and artificial intelligence that can provide outstanding assistance to an Alzheimer’s disease patient. 3D laser sensers and cameras will not only help to detect and recognise objects and human faces but also will avoid collations. This robot will have a head with two eyes and mouth, two legs and two arms with 150 cm height. Emotional engagement with patient will be the main attraction of this robot. RoboAD needs a Wi-Fi and a 4G connection to do most of its assigned tasks. It can move around the home or hospital autonomously.
           <br>
       </p3>
       <p4><br>
         This robot can be programmed via 12-inch sized in-built HD touch screen or a personal computer or a smart phone. This user-friendly and human sized robot will respond to human speech and its powerful sensors can able to monitor and collect comprehensive data and most of vital medical information from a patient including recording blood pressure, body temperature, sugar levels and pulse rates by a simple and gentle touch. RoboAD will respond to emergency situations when patient will have medical conditions like high blood pressure, cardiac arrest and stroke or an accident; will pass information to a family member or a nurse. AI OS will help to take blood and other samples and analyse and store them. RoboAD will send this information to family members or a nurse or a doctor for records. 
           <br>
           </p4>
       <p5><br>     This robot can be controlled with voice assistance and remotely including software upgrades; will generate alerts and remind the patients about their daily routines including medication, exercises, contact their loved ones and even will work as yoga teacher. Patients can make this robot as communication tool; they can make and receive voice and video calls, can engage with social media like Facebook or twitter facilities. This robot can give endless entertainment experience to the patients like internet television, e-newspaper and radio. RoboAD will act as a caretaker like serve medicines, food, water, bed linens, towels, toothbrush and even lift the patient from floor or bed and can assist to do toilet activities and shower. RoboAD can pick up dirty plates, mugs, cups from a floor or table and can operate electronic equipment including washing machines, coffee maker, electric and micro ovens, dish-washer and air conditioners according to the instruction from a patient or a programmer. I always wanted to give these kinds of robotic experiences to my grandmother’s better life.  Another mission of this AI OS controlled robotic medical assistant to make zero errors with excellent accuracy in its performance, deliver highest safety measures with cutting edge technology.
           <br>
       
       </p5><br>
       <p6>  It will have two batteries for uninterrupted functions, convenience and safety. When battery charge is less than 15% or being ideal, RoboAD will automatically return to charging. According to Jaime Herndon, there is no medicine or cure for Alzheimer’s disease but treatment can help slowdown the progression of the disease and may improve the quality of life. Ultimate aim of my IT project is to provide enormous physical and emotional support for Alzheimer’s disease victims.However, this robot is a man-made machine so that a malfunction can be occur due to mechanical electrical or electronic failure; this malfunction will reflect it functions and safety measurements, can be led to serious consequences including accidents or deaths. Clinical trials and researches should be done before it come to the market.

       <h2>The software, hardware and/or other equipment needed</h2>
       <p7>
         My Autonomous robot is combination of advanced mechanical, electronical and software solutions.<br>
<h3>Mechanical / Electric / Electronic parts required:</h3>br>
 80V programmable brushless digital drive with CAN bus interfaces, brushless DC motors, Integrated motor drives, stepper motors, gears gearmotors and linear actuators for precision motion control positioning application, Cables and Harness Solutions, multi-senser modules ,hundreds of sensers including Photo Optic Sensers, Digital Sensors and Development Boards, fluid property sensors, Position Sensors, vibration sensers,12-inch touch screen, Force And Torque Sensors, fluid and property sensers Antennas, pressure and temperature scanners.
I am a Mechanical Engineer and a certified Computer Numerical Control (CNC) programmer so that I can able to do build body and chase of a robot by doing the fabrication works and design parts of this robot with the help of softwares including AutoCAD, SOLLIDWORKS (one of the leading 3D CAD design software). There is a company called Titomic in Melbourne and they are expert in 3D printing and manufacturer of heavy-duty aerospace components manufacturer. I will coordinate with Titomic and can get the parts from them.
           <h2>The software equipment:</h2><br>
Robot Operating System (ROS), AUTODESK’s software - AutoCAD, Eagle EDA (Electronic Design Automation), AR-R’s ASIS (Automated Surface Inspection Software) Python programming solutions for microcontrollers and proximity sensors.
           <br>
           </p7>
       <p8>  If my project become successful, this robot can fulfill millions of peoples wish including my grandmother. This robot can able to provide best possible assistance to people who suffer with various diseases including Alzheimer’s disease or this robot will be a good companion for who live alone without having any assistance. There will be huge demand for RoboAD in age care and childcare sector and in hospitals. This robot can able to play a significant role during the pandemic season like Covid19 when people require to maintain Social distancing.  This robot will reduce the sorrows and loneliness, restore happiness and better life.
